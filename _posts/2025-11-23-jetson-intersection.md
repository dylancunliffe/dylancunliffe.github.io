## 🚦 Overview and Motivation

Modern urban intersections are chaotic environments. My project aims to demonstrate how low-cost embedded systems can contribute to **safer and more intelligent intersections**.

I created a **real time intersection awareness system** using the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, a live camera feed from a usb webcam, the YOLOv8 object detection model, a push button for pedestrians, and a set of LED traffic lights. When the system detects a vehicle approaching from the side street, the camera picks it up, the yolo model detects a car, and a state machine triggers a cycle of the intersection. The user can also press a button to simulate a pedestrian requesting to cross.

My motivation for this project came from wanting to re-create a complete AI-driven intersection system using **only low-cost hardware and open-source tools**—something that simulates real-world infrastructure challenges but is hands-on and understandable at a student level.

The materials used for this project are:

- A **Jetson Orin Nano Super Dev Kit**
- A **USB webcam** to watch the intersection
- **YOLOv8** real-time object detection
- **Push-button input** for pedestrian crossing
- **LED traffic-light modules**
- 330–1kΩ **resistors**
- Jumper wires + **breadboard**  
- A **Python controller** that synchronizes everything using shared files

NVIDIA’s Jetson Orin Nano is a compact, power-efficient edge AI computer. It’s powerful enough to run **real-time YOLO detection** while simultaneously executing hardware control logic, making it ideal for embedded robotics, smart devices, and in this case, a computer vision intersection controller.

### Behavior summary

1. When YOLO detects vehicles on the side street, a car request is created. The main road completes the minimum green, then transitions to side green. Side green is extended adaptively while vehicles are present (to a maximum). The main green will not resume until all cars have left the intersection. This improves safety, ensuring the main street cars are not given a green, if other cars are still trying to turn.
2. Pedestrian button latches a guaranteed pedestrian time; if cars are present, the pedestrian waits until safe. If the pedestrian initiates the request, the side green is given for a minimum amount of time, longer than the minimum given for a car initiated request, to ensure the pedestrian is given sufficient time to cross.
3. Once all cars/pedestrians from the side street are clear of the intersection, the main green will resume, and will remain green until the next request is initiated.

## 1. System Architecture

The system runs using **three cooperating components**:

```text
Camera → YOLOv8 Detector → Shared File → Main Intersection Controller → LEDs + Walk Signal
                                      ↑
                           Pedestrian Button (GPIO)
```

### Modules  
1. **Vision Module (`yolo_detect.py`)**  
   - Reads camera frames  
   - Runs YOLOv8 inference  
   - Detects vehicles and updates `side_detected.txt`  

2. **Intersection Controller (`main_controller.py`)**  
   - Reads the shared detection file  
   - Monitors a pedestrian button  
   - Drives LEDs indicating whether it’s safe to cross

### Code — YOLO Detector (`yolo_detect.py`) (excerpt)

```python
import cv2
import tempfile
import os
from ultralytics import YOLO

MODEL_PATH = "yolov8n.onnx"
SHARED_FILE_PATH = "/tmp/side_detected.txt"
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.45
VEHICLE_CLASSES = [2, 3, 5, 7]  # car, motorcycle, bus, truck

def write_status(detected):
    content = "1" if detected else "0"
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False, dir='/tmp') as tmp:
        tmp.write(content)
        tmp.flush()
        os.fsync(tmp.fileno())
        tmp_name = tmp.name
    os.replace(tmp_name, SHARED_FILE_PATH)

model = YOLO(MODEL_PATH, task='detect')
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Make window resizable
cv2.namedWindow("YOLOv8 Detection", cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)
cv2.resizeWindow("YOLOv8 Detection", 1280, 720)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    results = model(frame, verbose=False, conf=CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD)
    car_detected = any(int(b.cls[0]) in VEHICLE_CLASSES for b in results[0].boxes)
    write_status(car_detected)
    annotated = results[0].plot()
    cv2.imshow("YOLOv8 Detection", annotated)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## 3. Pedestrian Button Input

### Code — Button Reader

```python
import Jetson.GPIO as GPIO
import time

PIN_BUTTON = 37
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
GPIO.setup(PIN_BUTTON, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)

while True:
    print(GPIO.input(PIN_BUTTON))  # 1 = pressed (active-high), 0 = not pressed
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

---

## 4. Main Controller Logic

The controller manages:
* **LED traffic lights** (Main + Side: R/Y/G)
* **Pedestrian requests** (latch + guaranteed pedestrian time)
* **Vehicle requests from YOLO** (latched, adaptive side-green extension)
* **Safety phases** (yellow + all-red intervals)

![State diagram](/assets/img/Gemini_Generated_Image_eoqri3eoqri3eoqr.png)

### Code — Main Controller (excerpt)

```python
# pin assignments (BOARD numbers)
PIN_MAIN_R = 15
PIN_MAIN_Y = 16
PIN_MAIN_G = 13
PIN_SIDE_R = 7
PIN_SIDE_Y = 11
PIN_SIDE_G = 12
PIN_BUTTON = 22
YOLO_FLAG_PATH = "/tmp/side_detected.txt"

# timing
MIN_MAIN_GREEN = 5.0
MAIN_YELLOW_TIME = 2.0
ALL_RED_TIME = 1.0
SIDE_PED_TIME = 8.0
SIDE_MIN_GREEN = 4.0
SIDE_MAX_GREEN = 15.0

# read YOLO flag
def read_yolo_car_present():
    try:
        with open(YOLO_FLAG_PATH, "r") as f:
            return f.read().strip() == "1"
    except:
        return False
```

### State transition example

```python
if state == "MAIN_GREEN":
    if (req_pedestrian or req_car) and time_in_state >= MIN_MAIN_GREEN:
        state = "MAIN_YELLOW"
        set_lights(0,1,0, 1,0,0)  # main yellow, side red
```
