## Overview

**Sea-to-School Forecasting** is a full end-to-end commute prediction system built to estimate travel time from **West Vancouver → UBC** using:

- A custom **ESP32 embedded device** for GPS data collection  
- A c-based **prediction engine**  
- A **segment-based route algorithm**  
- A pipeline for historical data analysis  

The project combines embedded systems, data engineering, and predictive modelling into a polished engineering portfolio piece backed by real commute data.

## Motivation

The commute from **West Vancouver to UBC** is influenced by:

- Bridge congestion  
- Traffic choke points  
- Time-of-day patterns  
- Campus-specific traffic flows  

The objective was to build a system that answers:

> **“If I left right now, how long would my commute take?”**

To accomplish this, I built:

1. A physical embedded device to record commute times  
2. A data pipeline to clean and segment the route data 
3. A prediction engine that models traversal durations  
4. A system that can be extended to real-time edge forecasting

## Embedded Device & Firmware

### Hardware  
- ESP32 DevKit  
- NEO-6M GPS module  
- SD card module  
- Custom breadboard wiring  

### Features  
- High-frequency GPS logging  
- Buffered SD writing  
- Automatic file rollover  
- Handling for temporary GPS loss  

### Example Firmware Snippet

````cpp
  if (dataFile) {
    // Log location
    if (gps.location.isValid()) {
      dataFile.print(gps.location.lat(), 6);
      dataFile.print(",");
      dataFile.print(gps.location.lng(), 6);
      dataFile.print(",");
    } else {
      dataFile.print("INVALID_LAT,INVALID_LNG,");
    }

### *Insert Photo Placeholder*  
**Photo of the ESP32 + GPS + SD hardware mounted in the vehicle.**

### Major Fix  
I spent weeks debugging a seemlingly unfixable issue, where I could not get my SD card reader to initialize my SD card. I went through various stages of trying to debut the wiring, code, and SD card, before concluding the unit must be the issue. It was, and a new SD card reader worked immediately upon installation.

### Additional Note 
The GPS must lock on to 3 satellites before it can output raw nmea sentences, but this takes time, upwards of 5 minutes if inside or out of direct view of the sky. To improve the robustness of this system, a small battery should be included to **keep the GPS powered when the ESP is turned off**, so that it never loses its gps lock, and can therefore **boot significantly faster**. This idea was implemented on a future project, my telemetry pcb, to ensure the vehicle can output gps data immediately.

Raw logs are stored as CSV files on the SD card. The data pipeline:

1. Loads raw GPS logs  
2. Removes invalid points  
3. Smooths jitter    
5. Detects segment boundaries  
6. Produces per-segment traversal durations  

### Example Segment Extraction Code

````C ++
		// Read each line from the file, and store the data in the ESPData array
		while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), filepointer) != NULL) {
			if (count >= MAX_ESP_DATA_POINTS) {
				printf("Maximum ESP data points reached. Some data may not be read.\n");
				break;
			}
			int n = sscanf(buffer, "%[^,],%[^,],%lf,%[^,],%[^,],%[^,],%[^\n]",
				latStr,
				lonStr,
				&tempSpeed,
				yearStr,
				monthStr,
				dayStr,
				timeStr
			);

			// Check if the line was parsed correctly by confirming the number of items read
			if (n != 7) {
				printf("Error parsing ESP data line: %s\n", buffer);
				continue; // Skip malformed lines
			}

			// Confirm validity of parsed data
			if (strcmp(latStr, "INVALID_LAT") == 0 || strcmp(lonStr, "INVALID_LNG") == 0 || strcmp(yearStr, "INVALID_DATE") == 0 || strcmp(timeStr, "INVALID_TIME") == 0) {
				printf("Skipping invalid ESP data point: %s\n", buffer);
				continue; // Skip invalid data points
			}

This code produces an output file, which contains the time for each segment for each drive as a csv entry for later analysis.

## Prediction Engine

The route model treats the commute as a series of independent travel segments. This minimizes outliers by segmenting delays, ensuring time and day of week specific delays are accurately represented.

Each segment stores:

- Mean traversal time  
- Variance  
- Smoothed historical average  
- Last recorded duration  

### Example Model

````C ++
void predictSegmentDuration(int* segment_id, ValidTraversal *traversals, int traversalCount, int targetYear, int targetMonth, int targetDay, int targetTime, int targetDOW, double* predictedMean, double* predictedStdDev) {
	double* durations = (double*) malloc(MAX_TRAVERSALS * sizeof(double));
	double* weights = (double*) malloc(MAX_TRAVERSALS * sizeof(double));
	int count = 0;

	// Collect durations and weights for the specified segment from array of all traversals
	for(int i = 0; i < traversalCount; i++) {
		if(traversals[i].segment_id == *segment_id) {
			durations[count] = (double)traversals[i].duration; // Store duration
			weights[count] = computeWeights(traversals[i], targetTime, targetDOW, targetYear, targetMonth, targetDay); // Compute and store weight
			count++;
		}
	}

	weightedMeanAndStd(durations, weights, count, predictedMean, predictedStdDev);

	free(durations);
	free(weights);
}

### Major Fix  
Originally, each segment prediction **started at time 0**, causing stacking errors.  
The corrected version ensures each segment starts **when the previous one ends**.

---

## Data Analysis & Results

All analysis was done via my c program and a small python script.

Data visualizations:
- Commute time for every minute of the day
- Commute time for the same time on different days of the week
- Commute time per segment
- Segment map to visualize above results

Further suggested visualizations:

- Total commute time vs. date  
- Segment-level traversal time distributions  
- Box plots of morning vs afternoon traffic  
- Route animation using GPS points  

---

## Route Segmentation

The commute is split into logical segments such as:

- Park Royal → Lions Gate Bridge  
- Start of bridge → Stanley Park causeway 
- Pacific St. → Burrard St. Bridge  
- W 4th Ave → UBC Entrance 
- UBC Entrance → Fraser River Parkade  

Each segment boundary corresponds to GPS-detected distance thresholds.

## Architecture

### System Flow  
1. **ESP32 device logs a commute**  
2. Data is saved to SD as `.csv`  
3. C pipeline parses + cleans it  
4. Segments are computed  
5. Statistics updated  
6. Prediction engine outputs total commute time
