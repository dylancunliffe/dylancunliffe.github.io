Hello, I'm Dylan Cunliffe, an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). My focus lies at the intersection of Hardware Design, Power Systems, Embedded Systems, Digital Logic, and Machine Learning.

I am driven by complex technical challenges that require solving problems across the hardware/software boundary. Thank you for checking out my project portfolio, please reach out if you have any questions!
