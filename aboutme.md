Hello, I'm Dylan Cunliffe, an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). My interests are primarily around hardware design, power systems, embedded systems, and machine learning. I enjoy engineering novel projects that integrate both hardware and software design to solve real world problems. Thank you for checking out my project portfolio, please reach out if you have any questions!
